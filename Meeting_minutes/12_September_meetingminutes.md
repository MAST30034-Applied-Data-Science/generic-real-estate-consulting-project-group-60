-**URGENT:**

Methods:
plan1:use the average price instead of the original house price, the basic information of the house with 2022, because do not care about the basic information of the house, use 2017-2021 to make a model learn, and then see if the 2022 accuracy is high, if high then continue, such a method because the data set is large, so do not have to use a very difficult method to predict the regional .Because of the large dataset, we don't have to use difficult methods to predict the regional population and income, there will be more things to talk about and discuss.

plan2: use 2022 as the train and test and then see the accuracy rate, the data of that model is too small, so we need a better method to predict population and income, it will be easier.

plan3: change the format. To predict different room types in each area, equivalent to the price of different room types in each SA2 area, the price of a 1-bedroom flat in SA2 and the price of a 2-bedroom flat in SA2.
