### Agenda:
-**Assumptions**
1.We assume the nearest straight distance school also have the nearest driving distance.


-**Decide the data collectin method**

-**Mind Storming**




---
Now finishing the prediction for income and population.

No API in code.





#### **External data set:**

(Breakdown to SA2) needs to use area name, Data Year :2017, 2022

Total population. (2017-2021, use data to predict 2022 population by SA2, decide whether can find the data, need to get 2017, 2022‚Äôs data) ->len,Steven. üëÄÔ∏è/Year

Income. (2017,2022Ôºåbreak down to SA2 region,method to get the data collection need to be decided) -> Cecily,Kevin üëÄÔ∏è/year

Distance to hospital(API 2020,2021, Longitude, latitude)

Distance to School (2017-2022)‚úÖ

public tranport(Victoria train stationÔºåairport station Longitude, latitude)2021/2022) -> Aaron

Interest rateÔºàSteven TBDÔºüÔºâ(2017 and. 2022,Break down to SA2, if cannot find, ignore it)->Steven

-**Using the history sold out **
-**Geo visulization**

-**data preprocessing**

-**URGENT:**

- Public Transport Victoria data‚úÖ
- Another other Geospatial API that can assist.
