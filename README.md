* Then using he python script `APINowData.py` to get the Information needed by calling the API.

### 2. Feature Prediction

### 3. Data Preprocessing

### 4. Modelling

üëÄÔ∏èAll plots could save into `plots`.

Since the folium graph cannot be saved to the computer, using the built-in print function in the web browser to print out the pictures.
