**Summary_Notebook**Ôºö Summarising the overall approach, please find it at `notebooks/summary_notebook.ipynb`

**Datasets:**

* Historical data
* 2022 data

**External datasets:**

All location data file will be saved into the `data/Geo_data`

* School Location: `data/Geo_data/schoolLocations2022.csv` üëÄÔ∏è From: [https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/school-locations-2022](https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/school-locations-2022).
* Police Station: `data/Geo_data/POLICE_STATION.csv` üëÄÔ∏è From: [https://data.aurin.org.au/dataset/vic-govt-delwp-datavic-vmfeat-police-station-na](https://data.aurin.org.au/dataset/vic-govt-delwp-datavic-vmfeat-police-station-nahttps://).

* SA2 area shape file: `data/Geo_data/1270055001_sa2_2016_aust_shape` üëÄÔ∏è From: [https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1270.0.55.001July%202016?OpenDocument](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1270.0.55.001July%202016?OpenDocument)

The `requirements.txt`is attached in the root directory, which is produced by the command `pip3 list --format=freeze > requirements.txt`.

To run the pipeline, please visit the `scripts` directory first(since the historical data request website is not allowed to using the web script, the historical data has been saveed into the `data/Property` and then visit the `notebooks` directory.

## Steps

### 1. Data Scraping

### Openroute Service API:

Supported by 2022 ***openrouteservice***

API keys was requested from the website: [https://openrouteservice.org](https://openrouteservice.org) and stored into the local environment `.env`.

Using the open route service API to get the information needed:

* The information needed to be preprocessed first by using the notebook `notebooks/Prepare_distance_to_nowProperty.ipynb`  and the notebook `notebooks/Prepare_distance_to_historicalProperty.ipynb` . Saving to file `data/curated` , called `historical_property.csv` and `new_property.csv`.
* The API keys  stored at the local environment, they can be accessed by running the notebook `notebooks/get_API_keys.ipynb`, and also the `.env` is added to `.gitignore` due to the security purpose.
* Then using the python script `scripts/to_nowProperty_api.py` and `scripts/to_historicalProperty_api.py` to get the Information needed by calling the API.

After running the the python scripts above, the informnation would be stored into the file `data/curated`. Called `historical_property.csv` and `new_property.csv`.

### Web Scraping

Data scrape from

1. Domain(2022 Data): [https://www.domain.com.au](https://www.domain.com.au).
2. OldListing(Historical Data): [https://www.oldlistings.com.au](https://www.oldlistings.com.au).
3. WorldPostalCodes(Get full postcode list in VIC): [https://www.worldpostalcodes.org/l1/en/au/australia/list/r1/list-of-postcodes-in-victoria](https://www.worldpostalcodes.org/l1/en/au/australia/list/r1/list-of-postcodes-in-victoria).

* `script/web_scrapping_2022.py`: Scrapping the data from domain, and the output is the 2022 data
* `script/oldListingScrapper.py`: Scrapping the data from OldListing, and the output is the Historical data

After running the the python scripts above, the informnation would be stored into the file `data/Property`. Called `15000_property.json` and `history_data.csv`.

### 2. Feature Prediction

* `notebooks/Income_prediction.ipynb*`: Predict income by linear regression
* `notebooks/population_predcition.ipynb*`: Predict population by using population prediction from:[https://www.invest.vic.gov.au/resources/statistics/victoria-in-future-population-and-households-projections-to-2051] and linear regression

### 3. Data Preprocessing

* `notebooks/Data_preprocess_2017_2021#1`: read the full historic data after scrapping, find the closest SA2 region, merge the population and income into the dataset.
* `notebooks/Data_preprocessing_2022#2`: read the 2022 current data after scrapping, find the closest SA2 region, merge the population and incoem into the dataset.
* `notebooks/produce_23_25_data#3`: Produce the 2025-2025 data, including merge the future population and income.
* `notebooks/Data_preprocess_merge_2017_2022#4`: Merge the 2017-2022 data together with a various of data preprocessing.
* `notebooks/Hospital#5`: Adding the number of hospital nearby inside both 2017-2022 and 2023-2025 data.
* `notebooks/data_cleaning#6`: After all the data preprocessing, remove all the outliers inside the 2017-2022 data, to avoid any invalid results.
* `notebooks/Feature selection#7`: Doing applied the feature selection method using random forest.

### 4. Modelling

* `notebooks/statmodel.ipynb`: ols,glm model
* `notebooks/Random_forest#8`: Random forest model.
* `notebooks/Live__afford_rate.ipynb`: Create livability and affordability rate by the weighted index from feature selection.

### 5. Graph Drawing of Location

All geo-visulization Graph are produced by notebooks :`notebooks/Visulization of maps.ipynb` and`notebooks/Visulization_API_Compare.ipynb`.

üëÄÔ∏èAll plots could save into `plots`.

Since the folium graph cannot be saved to the computer, using the built-in print function in the web browser to print out the pictures.

### 6. Other visualization

Creating the dataframe about the top10 region, and the csv are used to produce linear and bar plot in Tableau.

* `notebooks/visualization_of_rent_growth_rate.ipynb`: Running from top to down would get the csv about some data summary from top 10 region and last 10 region.
* `notebooks/find_common_feature.ipynb`: Running from top to down would get the csv about the data summary in top 1 region
* `plots/week_rent_change.twbx`: Opening this work book in Tableau Cloud could generate the plot about the variation of weekly rent in top10 region.

After running the the python scripts above besides tableau workbook, the informnation would be stored into the file `data/curated`.
